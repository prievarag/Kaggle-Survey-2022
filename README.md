<h1> Key Findings : </h1>


- Most of the participants completed the survey in a relatively short time. I think there was a few thousand respondents thought more about the questions.
- As we can see, the majority of those who completed the survey were men.
- As you can see, students filled out the survey in approximately the same proportion as non-students.
- Most of the participants are very young. In my opinion, this may be because DS is a young science.
- Most of the participants come from India (36%)
- Most of the people have Master's degree or Bachelor's degree, which is understandable, since the profession requires, among other things, statistical and mathematical knowledge.
- As we can see, most of the participants are relative beginners: more than half of them have been writing codes for less than 3 years. It is in line with our previous finding that there are a lot of young people in the Data Science field.
- It's not surprising: most of the participants are Data Scientists. In second place are Data Analysts, which is understandable as well. 
- But it is interesting that in the third place there are participants currently not employed. They must be students. It is a bit surprising for me how few Data Engineers there are (11th place).

<h1> Recommendations: </h1>

- We are waiting for the 2023 Kaggle Survey, it will be even more exciting!
